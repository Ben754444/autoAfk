# autoAfk
powercord plugin - automatically change your status when you go afk

i am aware that discord supposedly does this automatically - but i know it doesnt work if you use dnd and i've never witnessed it myself. also mine can change the status so stfu

not really meant for public use due to the lack of customisation and dodgy code, use at your own discretion
